### Making AI accessible

## What is algoLink?
algoLink is a webservice for hosting, publishing and testing your datasets.
It was specifically created for making datasets open-source so you can use suitable
data for your data science project.



# Heads Up
The server is an express server. The node modules are not in the repo as I am working locally and I am not using github as a version control tool but more as a 
cloud storage to save backups. That's also why some projects aren't up to date.
